# [LSTM rule extraction](https://github.com/ZeweiChu/rule_extract_lstm)

This repository tries to replicate the results of 
[Automatic Rule Extraction from Long Short Term Memory Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02540)

- We use Yelp review dataset and [sentiment analysis dataset](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~kgimpel/teaching/31210/assignments.html) from TTIC31210 assignment 1 
- some heatmap results can be viewed from [here](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~zeweichu/lstm_rule_extract/)

This repository is not guarenteed to be bug free, but you are welcome to report any bugs to me. 

This repo is forked from [github](https://github.com/ZeweiChu/rule_extract_lstm).
The original repo is not maintained for a long time.  
I have fixed some bugs with @JiCoM, and upload the code here.  
I will continue work on this project.  
**Our goal is to try to extract rules from labeled text data.**
